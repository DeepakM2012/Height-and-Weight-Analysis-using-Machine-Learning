# Height and Weight Analysis using Machine Learning

This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between height and weight using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The notebook demonstrates preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation to understand how body measurements correlate and how predictions can be generated from the dataset.

The project provides a simple example of applying regression techniques to real-world data.
